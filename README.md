# Simple Mouse Cursor

A lightweight, standalone addon that enhances cursor visibility during gameplay by displaying customizable rings, indicators, and optional effects around your mouse cursor.  
Originally based on a popular WeakAura concept, rebuilt from scratch as a more performant and reliable addon with **zero dependencies**.
